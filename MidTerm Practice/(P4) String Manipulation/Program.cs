             * Then ask the user for input on what word they want to look for in the above sentence, 
             * and what word they want to change it to (easier if this is two separate inputs). 
             * If the word they want to look for is not present in the sentence, output "Sorry, 
             * I could not find your word {INSERT THEIR WORD HERE}." and then output their word they 
             * wanted you to look for in reverse order, using a loop (e.g. if their word was puppy, 
             * you would output yppup).  If the word does exist in the sentence, replace all occurrences of 
             * it with the word they wanted to replace it with and output the new sentence with the words replaced.*/
