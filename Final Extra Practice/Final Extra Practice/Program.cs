You are the owner of a small coffee shop. In order to get more people to your website, you want to create a 
            “Coffee House Game” that website visitors can play. The game will call the GetMenu method to display 
            the menu, and then ask the user what they want to order. Then, the application should call the Calculate 
            Price method and the Display Receipt method. When the receipt for that item has been displayed, 
            the application should ask the user if they would like to order anything else. Once they say no, the 
            application should output the total of everything the user has ordered. The application should also 
            thank the user for playing before closing. 

You must create these three methods:

    Method 1: You need to create a method named GetMenu that accepts 0 parameters and has a return type of string.
            The method will display the coffee shop menu for the user.

Coffee Shop Menu

Fresh Coffee ------ $2.25

Café au lait ------ $3.72

Latte ------ $4.03

Hot Chocolate ------ $3.51

Pumpkin Spice ------ $7.30

    Method 2: You need to create a method named CalculatePrice that accepts one parameter of type string and 
            returns a double. The method should determine the price of the selected menu item.

    Method 3: You need to create a method called ShowReceipt that accepts one parameter of type double and a return
            type of void. The method should write a message on the console with the subtotal, tax, and total for the
            item the user specified. Tax rate is 8.5%.*/
